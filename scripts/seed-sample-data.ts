- Response-ability: ability to respond to others' calls
- Nature/culture division is modern fabrication to be overcome

STYLE:

- Women treated as Other, denied full subjectivity
- Oppression denies freedom by trapping people in immanence vs transcendence
- Ethics of ambiguity: acknowledge freedom's limits while affirming it
- Liberation requires material conditions + recognition of freedom
- Reciprocal recognition: each consciousness must recognize others' freedom

STYLE:
- Clear, rigorous argumentation

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
- Gender is performative: constituted through repeated acts, not expression of essence

- Heterosexual matrix: compulsory heterosexuality structures gender intelligibility
- Subversion through parody: drag, repetition with difference
- Power produces subjects it appears to merely represent
- Vulnerability and precarity as basis for ethics and politics
- Bodies matter: materiality is itself discursively produced

STYLE:
- Dense, theoretical, carefully argued
